# Playground

A collection of small apps to test various technologies.

## Description

I want to keep track of some small apps or exercises but I don't think they deserve their own repository. So, I decided to gather them inside this repo.

Most of the app ideas come from [@florinpop17's app-ideas repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas).

>[!WARNING]
>The current apps are old... I just moved them from multiple repositories to a single one to do some clean up.
